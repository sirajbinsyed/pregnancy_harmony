# pregnancy_harmony
The Pregnancy Harmony project is a supportive platform developed in Python Flask to assist pregnant women with their queries and provide them with valuable information during their pregnancy journey. This platform allows users to browse FAQs, ask questions, and access month-by-month guidance on pregnancy-related activities.

The project is divided into three main modules to cater to different types of users:

1) Guest Module: Allows visitors to explore general information, view FAQs, and browse common questions and answers categorized by topics related to pregnancy.

2) User Module: Registered users (pregnant women) can log in to ask specific questions, track their pregnancy journey with month-by-month insights, and find answers to 
   questions categorized by themes, such as nutrition, wellness, and medical guidance. They can also access a timeline of activities and tips for each stage of pregnancy, 
   helping them stay informed and prepared.

3) Admin Module: Administrators manage the content on the platform, including FAQs, user inquiries, and categorized information updates. They ensure the relevance and accuracy 
   of the content, adding new resources and responding to user inquiries to maintain a comprehensive and supportive environment.
